The dsm2utils package contains a collection of utilities for working with DSM2 tidefiles. This ranges from reading basic metadata (e.g., start and end datetimes) to extracting flows for a particular (external) channel number.

## Read tidefile metadata

```{r setup}
library(dsm2utils)
out <- summarizeTidefile(system.file("extdata", "hist_v82.h5", package="dsm2utils", mustWork=TRUE))
```
